This repository is the official implementation of the proposed architecture in the paper "Lightweight Yet Effective: A Modular Approach to Crack Segmentation".

The proposed model was trained and tested on five datasets "Crack500, DeepCrack, GAPs384, AigleRN-TRIMM, and ShadowCrack". The datasets in this repository are NOT the original datasets but a cropped version, which we cropped using the code in the file "image_crop". If you want to use the original datasets, then refer to the links below:
